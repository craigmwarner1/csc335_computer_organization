MAKING CHANGES:
===============

To make changes to the provided image, you will need access to the Dockerfile. The Docker documentation will be very useful if you are not familiar with the syntax. Essential software provided in the Dockerfile consists of:

	supervisor 
	openssh-server 
	pwgen 
	sudo 
	vim-tiny 
        net-tools 
	x11vnc 
	xvfb 
	lxde 
        gtk2-engines-murrine 
	ttf-ubuntu-font-family 
        nginx

as provided within the original file.

In order to add/remove software from the container image, simply include it in the "RUN apt-get install -y..." command or write in your own identical command with only the extra software. If you would like to add any of the software included that is not found in the APT package index, you will have to put the commands into the Dockerfile using the appropriate commands.
